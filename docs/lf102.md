# Lovefield 102: Advanced Usage

## Join select

In SQL, there are four different joins defined: inner join, left outer join,
right outer join, and full outer join. In Lovefield, _only inner join and left
outer join are defined_.

Again, it's not my intention to lecture the relational database course. If you
have questions regarding the differences and details of joins, please refer to
[available online class materials like this one](https://cs145-fa19.github.io/).

Inner joins are used to find intersection of two data sets, for example,
"give me the names of customer in orders table, you can find the customer name
from the customer table". Lovefield supports two different syntaxes of
inner join:

```javascript
// The following examples wanted to find all orders from a customer.

const order = db.getSchema().table('order');
const customer = db.getSchema().table('customer');

// Explicit inner join
//
// SQL equivalent:
// SELECT customer.name, order.date, order.amount
//   FROM order
//   INNER JOIN customer
//   ON order.customerId = customer.id
//   WHERE customerId = 1
//   ORDER BY date
const res = await db
    .select(customer.col('name'), order.col('date'), order.col('amount'))
    .from(order)
    .innerJoin(customer, order.col('customerId').eq(customer.col('id')))
    .where(order.col('customerId').eq(1))
    .orderBy(order.col('date'))
    .exec();

// Implicit inner join
//
// SQL equivalent:
// SELECT c.name, o.date, o.amount
//   FROM customer c, order o
//   WHERE c.id = o.customerId AND o.customerId = 1
//   ORDER BY o.date
const o = order;
const c = customer;
const res2 = await db
    .select(c.col('name'), o.col('date'), o.col('amount'))
    .from(c, o)
    .where(lf.op.and(
      c.col('id').eq(o.col('customerId')),
      o.col('customerId').eq(1)
    ))
    .orderBy(o.col('date'))
    .exec();

// In these cases Lovefield returns rows like this:
// [
//   {
//     Customer: {name: "John Smith"},
//     Order: {date: 2020-01-22T00:00:00.000Z, amount: 89.99}
//   },
//   {
//     Customer: {name: "John Smith"},
//     Order: {date: 2020-01-22T00:00:00.000Z, amount: 9.99}
//   }
// ]
```

By default the join query returns data in their corresponding hierarchy. To
flatten that, you will need to use the `as()` function:

```javascript
const res2 = await db
    .select(
        c.col('name').as('name'),
        o.col('date').as('date'),
        o.col('amount').as('amount')
    )
    .from(c, o)
    .where(lf.op.and(
      c.col('id').eq(o.col('customerId')),
      o.col('customerId').eq(1)
    ))
    .orderBy(o.col('date'))
    .exec();

// Results now become something like this:
// [
//   {name: "John Smith", date: 2020-01-22T00:00:00.000Z, amount: 89.99},
//   {name: "John Smith", date: 2020-01-22T00:00:00.000Z, amount: 9.99}
// ]
```

Sometimes we want to join data from within the same table. For example, find
all orders that is sold by and to the same person. In this case, we can do
__self inner join__:

```javascript
const o1 = db.getSchema().table('Order').as('o1');  // Must have as() function.
const o2 = db.getSchema().table('Order').as('o2');
const c = db.getSchema().table('Customer');

// Find orders sold by and to the same person.
const res = await db
    .select(
      c.col('name').as('name'),
      o1.col('date').as('date'),
      o1.col('amount').as('amount')
    )
    .from(c, o1, o2)
    .where(lf.op.and(
      o1.col('customerId').eq(o2.col('clerkId')),
      o1.col('customerId').eq(c.col('id'))
    ))
    .orderBy(o1.col('date'))
    .exec();
```

In some cases we will need to use left outer join. For example, when we want
to list all transactions from customers ordered by customer names. There will
be customers without transactions, and hence a left outer join will help show
that:

```javascript
// Left outer join
//
// SQL equivalent:
// SELECT c.name, o.amount, o.date
//   FROM customer c
//   LEFT OUTER JOIN order o ON c.id = o.customerId
//   ORDER BY c.name
const o = db.getSchema().table('Order');
const c = db.getSchema().table('Customer');
return await db
    .select(
      c.col('name').as('name'),
      o.col('amount').as('amount'),
      o.col('date').as('date')
    )
    .from(c)
    .leftOuterJoin(o, c.col('id').eq(o.col('customerId')))
    .orderBy(c.col('name'))
    .exec();
```

## Observers (read-only triggers)

Lovefield supports data observation, which means that when a `select()` query's
associated tables have changed, your handler will be called. This is designed to
handle a common scenario: data model is updated in the background via AJAX, and
we need a way to update foreground components when that happened.

```typescript
const o = db.getSchema().table('Order');
const query = db
    .select()
    .from(o)
    .where(o.col('date').between(lf.bind(0), lf.bind(1)));

const range: [Date, Date] = [];
const handler = changes => {
  // This handler is called every time when data inside order has changed.
  query
      .bind(range)
      .exec()
      .then(res => updateList(res));
};

// Start observing the change
db.observe(query, handler);

$('datePicker1').change(ev => {
  range = ev.target.value;
  handler();
});

$('back').click(() => {
  // Leaving this page, stop the observe.
  db.unobserve(query, handler);
});
```

In the example above, we assume there's a date-picker web component whose value
is an array with two elements, start and end date. When order table is updated
by any background AJAX, the observer will be triggered to update current UI.
When you no longer needs the observer, do remember to `unobserve()`.

## Transactions

A transaction is an atomic unit of execution: all queries inside a transaction
either succeed together (called __commit__), or fail together (called
__rollback__). If the transaction failed, data remained in their original state
untouched.

Transactions can be _implicit_ (triggered by calling `exec()` function in
Lovefield), or _explicit_. You control creation of an explicit transaction,
and also when to start the transaction and when to commit or rollback the
transaction. This is the real benefit of using Lovefield over IndexedDB.

Let's start with a quick example:

```javascript
async function setVacationsForNewEmployees(startDate) {
  const e = db.getSchema().table('Employee');
  const v = db.getSchema().table('Vacations');

  // All explicit transactions in Lovefield are read/write, which means you can
  // alter data and/or retrieve data within the same transaction.
  // createTransaction() returns a transaction object.
  const tx = db.createTransaction();

  // Secure the "scope" of queries, which means to lock these tables so that
  // there will not be surprises when our queries were run.
  await tx.begin([e, v]);

  const q1 =
      db.select(e.col('id')).from(e).where(e.col('hireDate').gt(startDate));

  // Attach will actually run the query in memory and get back the results.
  const res1 = await tx.attach(q1);
  const ids = res1.map(row => row['id']);

  // Update all employees found from q1 with 15 days of vacation.
  // Because we locked the table, we are sure that at this moment what we
  // selected from q1 will not be changed when we need to run q2.
  const q2 = db.update(v).set(v.col('days'), 15).where(v.col('empId').in(ids));
  await tx.attach(q2);

  // Remember, when you use tx.begin(), you MUST call tx.commit(). If tx went
  // out of scope, the DEFAULT IS ROLLBACK!
  return tx.commit();
}
```

Besides `attach()`, you can also call `exec()`. There are three main differences
between `attach()` and `exec()`:
* `exec()` automatically calculate scope and automatically commit when all
  queries are executed.
* `exec()` don't let you rollback it unless there's an error happening during
  its execution.
* Queries passed into `exec()` cannot depend on each other, i.e. later query
  can not use results from previous queries.

The following code snippet explains the differences:

```javascript
// Assume we have two queries defined: query1 and query2.
const tx1 = db.createTransaction();

// Run query1 first, then run query2. The transaction auto-commits when both
// queries are done.
tx1.exec([query1, query2]);

// Now let's do the same thing using begin-attach-commit.
const tx2 = db.createTransaction();
// You are allowed to lock the scope wider than needed. Useful in some cases.
await tx.begin([table1, table2]);
const res1 = await tx.attach(query1);
// It's possible for query2 to use query1's results.
const res2 = await tx.attach(query2);

return tx.commit();  // You can choose to do tx.rollback() when you wish.
```

To dig more into the concurrency model, let's see another example:

```javascript
// Assume we already have queries defined: query1 to query6.
const tx1 = db.createTransaction();

//
// Execute in order: query1, query2.
tx1.exec([query1, query2]);

// Run query3 first, then run query4.
// Because they call their own exec(), they run in their individual implicit
// transaction contexts.
query3.exec().then(() => query4.exec());

// Execute in parallel (syntactically): tx1, query3, query5, query6.
query5.exec();
query6.exec();

const tx2 = db.createTransaction();
tx2.exec([query7, query8]);
// Execute in parallel (syntactically): tx1, query3, query5, query6, tx2.
```

So technically transactions can run in parallel, and it is mentioned that
Lovefield does table-level locking. How would that affect parallel execution?
Let's use some more examples to explain:

```javascript
const c = db.getSchema().table('Customer');
const o = db.getSchema().table('Order');

// Select query implicit transaction, there will be a shared lock placed on
// table Customer.
const res = db.select().from(c).exec();

// Update query implicit transaction, there will be a write lock placed on
// table Customer. However, this will not affect previous query, and previous
// query will not see any of the changes made here.
db.update(c)
  .set(c.col('name'), 'Bar')
  .where(c.col('id').eq(1))
  .exec();

const tx = db.createTransaction();

// Explicit transaction attempting to lock both Customer table and Order table.
// In this case it will wait until the Customer table lock is freed by previous
// query.
tx.begin([c, o]);

// Another implicit transaction attempting to write Order. This will not
// run until previous tx committed/rolled back and release the table locks.
db.insertOrReplace().into(o).values([someOrder]).execute();
```

Therefore Lovefield's locking rules are very simple:

* Implicit transactions running `select()` queries create a shared lock on the
  associated tables. This lock only ensure proper _snapshot_, but will not block
  other writing queries.
* All other transaction types create a reserved lock on the associated tables.
  Any new transactions attempting to modify these tables will have to wait until
  the locks are lifted (i.e. transactions been committed or rolled back).

## Constraints

Lovefield supports quite a few constraints features in RDBMS:

* Primary key: uniquely identify each row in a database table.
* Unique: ensure all values in a column (or column tuples) are different.
* Not null: make sure values in a single column are not null.
* Foreign key: ensure values in a single column are existing in another table.

Constraints are done via indices, which are data structures that can help to
quickly find data (and therefore quickly identify if a constraint were violated
or not).

### Primary key and auto increment

Primary key is meant to uniquely identify each row in a database table. As a
result, it provides _auto-increment_ features. One can define an _integer_
column named id and set it to auto-increment. The database will automatically
generate a value for that column and ensure later rows have a higher number
than previous rows.

```javascript
schemaBuilder.createTable('OnlineTransactions')
    .addColumn('id', lf.Type.INTEGER)
    .addColumn('orderId', lf.Type.INTEGER)
    .addPrimaryKey(['id'], /* auto-increment */ true)
    .addForeignKey('fk_OrderId', {
      action: lf.ConstraintAction.RESTRICT,
      local: 'orderId',
      ref: 'Order.id'
    });

const db = await schemaBuilder.connect();
const ot = db.getSchema().table('OnlineTransactions');

const row = ot.createRow({orderId: 2});  // Do not assign |id| for a new row.
await db.insert().into(ot).values([row]).exec();  // |id| is auto-assigned.
```

Also, primary keys can be formed by tuples. For example,

```javascript
builder.createTable('AssetTag')
    ...
    // column pair (|tagId|, |assetId|) forms the primary key.
    .addPrimaryKey(['tagId', 'assetId']);
```

You can also control the default sorting order of primary keys:

```javascript
builder.createTable('Asset')
    ...
    .addPrimaryKey([{  // Use full index spec to construct primary key.
      name: 'id',
      order: lf.Order.DESC,  // The only way to override default lf.Order.ASC.
      autoIncrement: false
    }]);

builder.createTable('AssetTag')
    ...
    // column pair (|tagId|, |assetId|) forms the primary key.
    .addPrimaryKey([{
      name: 'tagId'   // Keep |tagId| sorting by default ASC
    }, {
      name: 'assetId',
      order: lf.Order.DESC  // Make |assetId| sort DESC
    }]);
```

### Unique

Unique keys only guarantee values in a column, or combination of columns, are
unique across the table. It does not allow specifying sorting order or
auto-increment like primary key. Unique key does involve creating an index on
the target column(s) so that its enforcement will be efficient.

### Not null

Lovefield takes a different approach compared to other RDBMS in this front.
In Lovefield, only `ARRAY_BUFFER` and `OBJECT` types are by default nullable,
and everything else is _not nullable_ by default. This means you can only add
columns to be nullable (by using `addNullable()` in the schema builder) instead.
If you were porting legacy RDBMS programs over, please note this subtle
difference.

### Foreign keys

Foreign keys are designed to enforce referential integrity. There are pros and
cons of enforcing that in a client-side database and thus please use it with
caution (i.e. know why you're using it and trade-off with performance hit).

The following statements must be true for all foreign key constraints:

* A foreign key constraint is placed between exactly two existing columns, the
  parent column (a.k.a. referenced) and the child column (a.k.a. referencing).
* The parent and child columns may belong to the same or to different tables.
* The parent and child columns must have the same indexable lf.Type.
* The parent column must be unique: either a primary key, or marked as unique.
* A child column of a constraint can not be declared as the parent column of
  another foreign key constraint (i.e. no foreign key constraint chains).
* Cyclic references are disallowed.

If any of the statements above is violated an `Exception.SYNTAX_ERROR` will be
thrown.

A foreign key can be either `ConstraintAction.RESTRICT` or
`ConstraintAction.CASCADE`. If no action mode is specified in the schema definition, the default value is `ConstraintAction.RESTRICT`. The differences
are:

* `RESTRICT`<br>
  In this mode _any constraint violation_ results in _cancelling the operation_
  that violated the constraint. __Parent__ table is the referenced table, and
  __child__ table is the referencing table.

  * `insert()`
    * Can't insert a row into the child table if there is no related
      row in the parent table.
  * `update()` or `insertOrReplace()`
    * Can't update the parent table's referenced column if the row being
      modified has related rows in the child table.
    * Can't update the child table's referencing column if it doesn't have a
      related row in the parent table.
  * `delete()`
    * Can't delete a row from the parent table if it has related rows in the
      child table.

* `CASCADE`
  In this mode a constraint violation results in modifying related tables as
  necessary to maintain data integrity.

  * `insert()` or `insertOrReplace()`
    * Same as in the `RESTRICT` mode. Note that for `insertOrReplace()` queries,
      there is no cascading. If cascading is desired, an `update()` query should
      be used instead.
  * `update()`:
    * When a column in the parent table is updated, all referencing columns
      should be automatically updated with the same value.
  * `delete()`
    * When a row in the parent is deleted, all related rows in the child table,
      should be automatically deleted.

There are also timing differences for foreign keys:
`ConstraintTiming.DEFERRABLE` or `ConstraintTiming.IMMEDIATE`. All `CASCADE`
foreign keys are `IMMEDIATE`. Therefore the timing differences are only
meaningful for `RESTRICT` foreign keys.

* `DEFERRABLE`
  A deferrable constraint is enforced _right before a transaction is committed_.
  The constraint can be violated by individual statements during the lifetime of
  the enclosing transaction, without any errors being thrown.

* `IMMEDIATE`
  An immediate constraint is enforced _during execution of each individual
  statement_.

## Index structure and persistent index

Currently Lovefield uses two different indices internally: a hash index for its
internal indexing, and B+ tree for all indices that specified in schema builder.
Due to lack of funding, this is not likely to change in the future (unless
we received contributions on other data structures, such as k-d tree, grid
files, or other index structure that can improve specific retrieval).

Since Lovefield loads all its data from data store to memory during
initialization, it also constructs the B+ tree indices needed on-the-fly. This
can make even bigger impact for database initialization, and therefore a
`persistentIndex()` option is provided:

```javascript
schemaBuilder.createTable('SomeTable')
    ...
    .addPrimaryKey(...)
    .addIndex(..,)
    .persistentIndex(true);  // Save indices to disk, do not build on-the-fly.
```

Give that option in the table builder will force Lovefield to save a copy
of index structure onto data store when it needs to. As a result, this will
slightly impact every write query's performance (because index changes also
need to be flushed to disk), in exchange of better initial loading time. Users
are supposed to conduct their own experiments to check if persistentIndex
meet their own performance requirements. As a library author, I cannot tell
if this option is good for you because I cannot predict index structures
generated in the runtime.
