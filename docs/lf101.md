# Lovefield 101: Fundamentals

Lovefield is a relational database written in JavaScript and can be executed
on browsers. Relational database is a huge topic and it's not my intention
to lecture what it is. For those who do not understand what relational database
is and how to use it, Stanford University has generously offered their course
materials online:

[CS145: Data Management and Data Systems](https://cs145-fa19.github.io/)

In this document, it is assumed the readers know the fundamentals of relational
databases.

## Limitations of Lovefield

### Technical limitations

Different database systems are designed for different usages. Lovefield is
constrained by available browser heaps and therefore one can assume that
Lovefield can operate on less than 2GB of memory (when the browser process
will become extremely slow). A safer bet is __the database size should be around
or below 500MB__.

__During initialization, Lovefield loads everything from persistent store into
memory__ because there is not a reliable memory swap provided by
HTML5/Javascript and the only reliable lock is JavaScript's single-main-thread
policy.

Knowing these two technical constraints are crucial for the usage of Lovefield
library.

### Artificial limitations

All naming in Lovefield must pass the following JavaScript regex check:

```javascript
/^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/.test(name)
```

Names that violates this check will result in exceptions.

## Schema and builder pattern

Lovefield uses builder pattern to create schema. As a result, every database
starts with requesting a schema builder:

```javascript
const builder = lf.schema.create(
    /* database name */ 'HR',
    /* database version */ 1
);
```

All database instances are identified by the combination of origin and database
name. The version is used to determine whether to trigger a database upgrade or
not since __Lovefield assumes the schema is the same if the version number of
a given database does not change__.

One can use the builder to define table schema:

```javascript
builder.createTable('Asset')
    .addColumn('id', lf.Type.STRING)
    .addColumn('asset', lf.Type.STRING)
    .addColumn('owner', lf.Type.STRING)
    .addColumn('acquisitionDate', lf.Type.DATE_TIME)
    .addColumn('tagId', lf.Type.STRING)
    .addPrimaryKey(['id'])
    .addNullable(['owner'])
    .addUnique(['tagId']);
```

### Column types

A table schema contains _column(s)_ and/or _index(es)_ and _constraint(s)_. A
table contains at least one column, which is added using `addColumn()` API. Each
column must associate with a data type:

|Type|Default value|Nullable by default|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|`Type.ARRAY_BUFFER`|`null`|Yes|JavaScript `ArrayBuffer` object|
|`Type.BOOLEAN`|`false`|No|JavaScript `boolean`|
|`Type.DATE_TIME`|`Date(0)`|No|JavaScript `Date` object|
|`Type.INTEGER`|`0`|No|JavaScript `number` assuming to be integer|
|`Type.NUMBER`|`0`|No|JavaScript `number` assuming to be decimals|
|`Type.STRING`|`''`|No|JavaScript `string`|
|`Type.OBJECT`|`null`|Yes|JavaScript `Object` stored as-is|

_Nullable_ means a column can be `null`. In Lovefield, JavaScript `null` is
used to represent `NULL` value in RDBMS.

> You are not supposed to pass `undefined` or `null` for not null columns. Doing
> so will cause undefined behavior and/or errors.

### Index and constraints

Lovefield supports the following constraints

* Primary key (also serves as index)
* Unique key (also serves as index)
* Foreign key (indirectly serves as index)
* Nullable / Not-nullable

Primary key, unique key, and indices can be added to a table via
`addPrimaryKey()`, `addUnique()`, `addIndex()` accordingly. They all accept
an array of column names, which means _these columns in combination forms the
index_. For example:

```javascript
builder.createTable('Asset')
    ...
    .addPrimaryKey(['id']);   // column |id| is the *only* key.

builder.createTable('AssetTag')
    ...
    // column pair (|tagId|, |assetId|) forms the primary key.
    .addPrimaryKey(['tagId', 'assetId']);
```

`addNullable()` also accepts an array of column names, but it means every column
in this list can be nullable. They do not form indices.

We'll talk more about use of indices in later section.

## Connection and database instances

_Lovefield is designed to persist data within the browser client_. By default,
IndexedDB is used as Lovefield's data store. Why do we need Lovefield when
IndexedDB is supposed to work by itself? That's another story worth a separate
<s>rant</s> article about it, and we'll leave the spicy contents there.

Each database instance (i.e. persisted data within the browser client) is
identified by the tuple of `(origin, database name, database version)`. The
instance is accessed via the `connect()` function.

If there were no instances found in the browser, Lovefield will create a new
instance for you. If there were matching instance found, Lovefield will load
that instance into memory so that you can resume using it from the last session.

If you do not wish to persist your database within the browser storage, you
can instruct Lovefield to operate in _memory only_ mode:

```javascript
const db = await builder.connect({
  storeType: lf.DataStore.MEMORY
});
```

If you wish all database connections in your session to be in-memory only,
you can also use the options API to do so:

```javascript
lf.options.set({memoryOnly: true});
```

> Note: in node.js, only in-memory is supported and is already enforced in
> the node.js module offered.

When `connect()` is called, it will return a connection object that can be used
to run __queries__. At this moment the schema set in builder can no longer
change.


## Transaction and queries

A __query__ in relational database means a request to manipulate data or schema,
it can be insert/delete/update data, or retrieval of data (which is usually
named as _select_). All queries in Lovefield is executed in the context of a
__transaction__. A transaction is an atomic unit of execution: all queries
inside a transaction either succeed together (called __commit__), or fail
together (called __rollback__). If the transaction failed, data remained in
their original state untouched.

## Insert and update

All queries starts with inserting data into the database. To insert data, one
needs to create rows first:

```javascript
const item = db.getSchema().table('Item');  // get the |item| table schema

// Use table schema to create row
const row = item.createRow({
  id: 1234,
  description: 'a todo item',
  deadline: new Date(),
  done: false
});

// These two APIs are the few Lovefield synchronous API, they return concrete
// objects, not promises.
```

Once the rows are created, you can use one of the `insert()` queries to store
them into database:

```javascript
// This writes the |row| into the |item| table.
// If there were an existing row with the same primary key, it will raise
// an exception.
await db.insert().into(item).values([row]).exec();

// This writes the |row| into the |item| table.
// If there were an existing row with the same primary key, it will replace
// that one with this |row|.
await db.insertOrReplace().into(item).values([row]).exec();

// Queries are all promise-based APIs. So either handle the promise, or use
// await syntax.
```

You can also just update some fields of an existing row without the need to
provide a full row:

```javascript
// Change the done field to true for todo item 1234.
await db.update(item).set(item.done, true).where(item.id.eq(1234)).exec();

// TypeScript users: use col() to avoid annoying typing errors.
const id = item.col('id');
const done = item.col('done');
await db.update(item).set(done, true).where(id.eq(1234)).exec();

// We'll just use col() for the rest of the examples.
```

### Search conditions

The `where()` function accepts __predicates__, also known as __search
conditions__, which are conditions for Lovefield to match the rows. To avoid
free text parsing and offer better security, Lovefield uses functions to
define the search conditions:

|Function|Name|Example|SQL Equivalent|
|--|--|--|--|
|`eq`|equals|`column.eq(value)`|`column = value`|
|`neq`|not equals|`column.neq(value)`|`column <> value`|
|`lt`|less than|`column.lt(value)`|`column < value`|
|`lte`|less than or equals to|`column.lte(value)`|`column <= value`|
|`gt`|greater than|`column.gt(value)`|`column > value`|
|`gte`|greater than or equals to|`column.gte(value)`|`column >= value`|
|`match`|regex match|`column.match(/\w*/)`|See Note below|
|`between`|between|`column.between(100, 200)`|`column BETWEEN 100 AND 200`|
|`in`|in the array|`column.in([1, 2, 3])`|`column IN (1, 2, 3)`|
|`isNull`|is null|`column.isNull()`|`column IS NULL`|
|`isNotNull`|is not null|`column.isNotNull()`|`column IS NOT NULL`|

> Note: `match` is similar to SQL `SIMILAR`, however, due to technical
> limitations, we can only offer JavaScript regex search instead.
> Please also note that `match` will force a full table scan, which means
> performance penalty.

## Delete

You can of course delete the rows that you do not want, for example:

```javascript
// Remove all done items from the database.
await delete().from(item).where(item.col('done').eq(true)).exec();
```

Once committed, the data is gone forever and there's no way to get it back.

You might wonder that previously we mentioned

> All queries in Lovefield is executed in the context of a __transaction__.

And where is that transaction? When you call the `exec()` function, it creates
an _implicit transaction_ to run that single query. When the promise is
resolved, the implicit transaction is committed.

## Select

Select queries are the most used queries in a relational database. Most use
cases will have at least 10x more select queries than all other queries
combined. Select queries retrieve data from the database.

Lovefield provides the following features for select query:

* Filtering via search conditions
* Sorting
* Paging
* Grouping
* Aggregation
* Join

### Filter just the fields needed (a.k.a. Projection)

You can filter the select results by specifying the fields needed instead of
getting back the full row. For example:

```javascript
// List the description of done items.
const descriptions = await db
    .select(item.col('description'))
    .from(item)
    .where(item.col('done').eq(true))
    .exec();

descriptions.forEach(desc => {
  // Returned value are object arrays, each object will have only one property
  // named 'description'.
  console.log(desc.description);
});

// Rename the returned object property to 'd'
const d2 = await db
    .select(item.col('description').as('d'))
    .from(item)
    .where(item.col('done').eq(true))
    .exec();

// Flatten returned value into a string array.
const res = d2.map(d => d['d']);
```

Lovefield _always_ return an array of objects as the result of `select()`
query, and by default the property names are the column names. The `as()`
function offered in column schema object will allow renaming the returned
property name into something else. This is especially useful for join, grouping,
and aggregations in later sections.

### Multiple search conditions

[Search conditions is briefly mentioned previously](#search-conditions). In
select query, you can also use `where()` to specify the search conditions:

```javascript
import * as lf from './node_modules/lovefield-ts/dist/es6/lf';

// List all to-do items.
const res = await db
    .select()
    .from(item)
    .where(item.col('done').eq(false))
    .exec();

// List all to-do items due today.
const start = new Date().setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const end = new Date().setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
const res = await db
    .select()
    .from(item)
    .where(lf.op.and(
      item.col('done').eq(false),
      item.col('deadline').between(start, end)
    ))
    .exec();
```

There can be _only one_ `where()` call in query, and thus to combine search
conditions, you'll need one of the combining predicates to help:

|Function|Example|SQL equivalent|
|--|--|--|
|`op.and`|`op.and(sc1, sc2)`|`sc1 AND sc2`|
||`op.and(sc1, sc2, sc3)`|`sc1 AND sc2 AND sc3`|
|`op.or`|`op.or(sc1, sc2)`|`sc1 OR sc2`|
||`op.or(sc1, sc2, sc3)`|`sc1 OR sc2 OR sc3`|
|`op.not`|`op.not(sc)`|`NOT sc`|

> Note: `op.and()` and `op.or()` accept two or more arguments.
> `op.not()` accepts only one argument.

## Sorting

Lovefield provides sorting for `select()` query results. For example:

```javascript
// Return TODO items sorted by their due date.
const res = await db
    .select()
    .from(item)
    .where(item.col('done').eq(false))
    .orderBy(item.col('deadline'))  // default to ascending, i.e. smaller first.
    .exec();
```

It's also possible to do advanced sorting, for example:

```javascript
import * as lf from './node_modules/lovefield-ts/dist/es6/lf';

// Return TODO items sort by their due date first,
// then reverse alphabetical order of description.
const res = await db
    .select()
    .from(item)
    .where(item.col('done').eq(false))
    // specifically called out sorting orders for better code maintainability.
    .orderBy(item.col('deadline'), lf.Order.ASC)
    .orderBy(item.col('description'), lf.Order.DESC)
    .exec();
```

There can be multiple `orderBy()` calls within a `select()` query, and the final
results will be sorted by the order of their appearance accordingly. One can
specify the sorting order by using the constants provided:

|Constant|Meaning|
|--|--|
|`Order.ASC`|ascending order, meaning smaller first, e.g. 1-9 A-Z|
|`Order.DESC`|descending order, meaning larger first, e.g. 9-1, Z-A|

### Paging

Paging of `select()` results are achieved by combining the `limit()` and
`skip()` functions together:

```javascript
const res = db
    .select()
    .from(item)
    .where(item.col('done').eq(false))
    .limit(10)  // return at most 10 items
    .skip(20)  // starting from the 21th elements if possible
    .exec();
```

This is very similar to SQL's `LIMIT` and `SKIP` syntax. Users to be aware of
the transactions in play:

```javascript
async function getPage(p) {
  return db
      .select()
      .from(item)
      .orderBy(item.col('deadline'))
      .limit(10)
      .skip(p * 10)
      .exec();
}

async function addData(r) {
  return db.insertOrReplace().into(item).values([r]).exec();
}

const res1 = await getPage(0);
await addData(r);
const res2 = await getPage(0);  // res2 may not be the same as res1!
```

If you changed the data in between `select()` calls, the results are picked at
the snapshot of the time that `select()` call is invoked. If you want to keep
a consistent snapshot, you'll need to use explicit transactions that will be
detailed in [Lovefield 102](lf102.md).

### Aggregation

A lot of time we are only interested in the aggregated results of target rows,
for example, number of rows, or a maximum value of a column in the target rows.
Lovefield provides the following aggregation functions for you to use:

|Function|SQL Equivalent|What is it?|
|--|--|--|--|
|`fn.avg(order.col('amount'))`|`AVG(order.amount)`|Arithmetic mean of all values in this column (`integer` and `number` types only)|
|`fn.count(order.col('id'))`|`COUNT(order.id)`|Number of rows matching this column (usually used in join query)|
|`fn.count()`|`COUNT(*)`|Number of rows of the associated table
|`fn.distinct(order.col('type'))`|`DISTINCT order.type`|All unique values of this column|
|`fn.geomean(order.col('amount'))`|None|Geomean of all values in this column (`integer` and `number` types only)|
|`fn.max(order.col('amount'))`|`MAX order.amount`|Maximum value of this column, applicable to `integer`, `number`, `string`, and `datetime`|
|`fn.min(order.col('amount'))`|`MIN order.amount`|Minimum value of this column, applicable to `integer`, `number`, `string`, and `datetime`|
|`fn.stddev(order.col('amount'))`|`STDDEV order.amount`|Standard deviation of this column (`integer` and `number` types only)|
|`fn.sum(order.col('amount'))`|`SUM order.amount`|Summation of all values in this column (`integer` and `number` types only)|

Here's a quick example showing its usage:

```javascript
import * as lf from './node_modules/lovefield-ts/dist/es6/lf';

const order = db.getSchema().table('order');
const amt = order.col('amount');
const res = await db
    .select(
      lf.fn.count().as('# of orders'),
      lf.fn.avg(amt).as('average amount')
    )
    .from(order)
    .exec();

// res will be returned as an array with only one element like this:
// {
//   "# of orders": 345,
//   "average amount": 12345.67
// }
```

### Grouping

With aggregators, sometimes we need separate groups to make the number even more
meaningful. For example, we usually wanted to know number of orders and average
amount _per day_ or _per customer_. In this case, we can use grouping:

```javascript
import * as lf from './node_modules/lovefield-ts/dist/es6/lf';

const order = db.getSchema().table('order');
const amt = order.col('amount');
const res = await db
    .select(
      order.col('customerId').as('cid'),
      lf.fn.count().as('cnt'),
      lf.fn.avg(amt).as('avg')
    )
    .from(order)
    .groupBy(order.col('customerId'))
    .orderBy(order.col('customerId'))
    .exec();

// res will be an array like this
// [
//   {cid: 1, cnt: 2, avg: 300.25},
//   {cid: 2, cnt: 4, avg: 172.25}
// ]
```

There are two important limitations of `groupBy()` that you need to keep in
mind:

* You can only `groupBy()` columns of type `integer`, `number`, `string`,
  `datetime`, and `boolean` (though groupBy boolean is NOT suggested)
* You can only project the `groupBy()` column alongside the aggregated columns.
  Any other columns will cause Lovefield to throw an exception. For example:

```javascript
// This will throw an error.
const res = await db
    .select(
      order.col('customerId').as('cid'),
      order.col('clerkId').as('agent'),  // ERROR!
      lf.fn.count().as('cnt'),
      lf.fn.avg(amt).as('avg')
    )
    .from(order)
    .groupBy(order.col('customerId'))
```

We have covered most of the fundamentals of using Lovefield so far. Lovefield
actually offers more features than just these, which we will reveal them in
the next session: [Lovefield 102](lf102.md).
